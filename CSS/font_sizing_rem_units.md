The main issue with using rem for font sizing is that the values are somewhat difficult to use. Letâ€™s see an example of some common font sizes expressed in rem units, assuming, of course, that the base size is **16px:**

- 10px = 0.625rem
- 12px = 0.75rem
- 14px = 0.875rem
- 16px = 1rem (base)
- 18px = 1.125rem
- 20px = 1.25rem
- 24px = 1.5rem
- 30px = 1.875rem
- 32px = 2rem
