If you’ve ever wanted to change the color of checkboxes or radio buttons, you’ve been seeking accent-color. 

With this property, you can modify the :checked appearance of radio buttons and checkboxes and the filled-in state for both the progress element and range input. 

The browser’s default focus “halo” may also be adjusted if you do not have another override.

```css
:root {
  accent-color: mediumvioletred;
}
```
