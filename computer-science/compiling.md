### Compiling

- `pre-processing`: process this first, includes the actual written code
- `compiling`: the code gets turned into `assembly code`, the lower level instructions your computer understands
- `assembly`: converting into `machine code`, ie 0s and 1s
- `linking`: libraries that you are using also converted and included

\* Often this whole 4-step process is just referred to as `compiling`<br>
\* Based on CS50 lecture
