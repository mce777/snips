## Data normalization

`Normalization` is a technique used to organize data in a way that reduces `data redundancy`.

Typically, when weâ€™re structuring data to be stored somewhere (whether that be a database, a client-side cache, or a JSON object), we want to reduce the amount of duplicate data saved. Ideally, we aim to have no duplicate data.

Relational databases set a great example of this. Through the use of `relationships` (primary keys, foreign keys) and constraints, we can `enforce unique` data getting added to the database only.
