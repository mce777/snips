### stack overflow
- `stacks`: LIFO (last in, first out)
- a `stack` is an array or list structure of function calls and parameters used in modern computer programming and CPU architecture
- a `stack overflow` is when a program attempts to use more space than is available to it or the call stacks
  - when it attempts to access memory beyond the call stack's bounds
