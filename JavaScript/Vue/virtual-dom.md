## what exactly is the virtual DOM?

virtual DOM << -- >> actual DOM<br>
blueprints << -- >> actual building<br>

Updating via virtual DOM like making changes in building by comparing before and after blueprints and only changing whatâ€™s different, instead of tearing everything down and rebuilding.

Under the hood, Vue compiles templates into Virtual DOM render functions.
